# PersonalWebsitePtI
This is the Personal Website PtI exercise. It includes the following:

MAIN INDEX HTML PAGE:
    --My name (main header)
    --A tagline
    --An avatar
    --A brief description of me
    --A little quote
    --An image credit

ABOUT HTML PAGE:
    --Main header
    --An image
    --A bio
    --A fun facts box
    --A skills box
    --An image credit

PORTFOLIO HTML PAGE:
    --A javascript alert that displays "hello world" and warns the audience that the page is under construction
    --A main header
    --An example of a project I've completed, including the project name, a screencap of the project, a project description, and a link to the github repository

NOTE: ALL HTML PAGES ALSO INCLUDE NAVIGATION BAR

STYLE CSS PAGE:
    --Provides necessary styling for the HTML pages

JAVASCRIPT PAGE:
    --Provides the javascript necessary to run the alert on the portfolio page.

I went kind of crazy with looking up CSS documentation and tailoring what I could find to make the end product look nice. As a result, some of the CSS doesn't strictly follow the box model and includes some extracurricular tags.

Thanks for your time, and have a great day!
