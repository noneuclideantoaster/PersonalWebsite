# PersonalWebsitePtI
This is the Personal Website exercise. Features are documented across version PT1 and PT2

--PART 1 NOTES--

MAIN INDEX HTML PAGE:
    --My name (main header)
    --A tagline
    --An avatar
    --A brief description of me
    --A little quote
    --An image credit

ABOUT HTML PAGE:
    --Main header
    --An image
    --A bio
    --A fun facts box
    --A skills box
    --An image credit

PORTFOLIO HTML PAGE:
    --A javascript alert that displays "hello world" and warns the audience that the page is under construction
    --A main header
    --An example of a project I've completed, including the project name, a screencap of the project, a project description, and a link to the github repository

NOTE: ALL HTML PAGES ALSO INCLUDE NAVIGATION BAR

STYLE CSS PAGE:
    --Provides necessary styling for the HTML pages

JAVASCRIPT PAGE:
    --Provides the javascript necessary to run the alert on the portfolio page.

I went kind of crazy with looking up CSS documentation and tailoring what I could find to make the end product look nice. As a result, some of the CSS doesn't strictly follow the box model and includes some extracurricular tags.

Thanks for your time, and have a great day!

--PART 2 NOTES--

THINGS ADDED:

--Contact.html, with a bootstrap contact form for name, email, and comments

--Success.html, which tells the user that their form has been submitted and redirects the user to index.html automatically (includes a link for manual redirection)

--Success.js, which includes the code for the automatic redirect and is linked into success.html

THINGS CHANGED:

--Altered javascript.js's alert message, where it appears, and prevented it from appearing on any linked page that isn't portfolio.html

--Added form functionality to javascript.js

--Added CSS for contact.html and success.html, as per the rubric requirements

--Added new feature branches to the repository to track changes

--Added collaborators to the repository who contributed to the project plan.
