          <strong>Kit Zihlman</strong> has lived in Colorado all of their life.
          They are currently located in Fort Collins, where they are studying
          fullstack development.
          <br />
          <br />
          When they aren't studying code, Kit is working a variety of
          front-facing customer service jobs. They have a diverse roster of
          experience, ranging from fast-paced bar employment in the downtown
          heart of their city to working at local wildlife shops.
          <br>
          <br>
          Kit is always up for exploring the town and mountains, finding new craft beers, and 
          talking about local birds. They have a backlog of video games years long to catch up on, 
          and when they have time, they enjoy sewing, drawing and painting, 
          and hanging out with their pet cat.
