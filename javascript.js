//Pseudocode:
//Create a "Hello World" message
//Add an alert that the page being viewed is under construction
//Link into the portfolio page

const greeting = "Hello World! ";
const construction = "The page you are viewing is currently under construction. Please check back later for more updates!";
alert(greeting + construction);

//The above creates a pop up alert that combines the two strings into a message.
